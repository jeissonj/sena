Hi! In this activity, I will develop a position of my house.

We have to start with the questions, Where is my house? and Which is my country?.

    This is my country. It is in the American continent. It's among countries like Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, etc.
    </p>
    <p> 
    I live specifically in the town of Sevilla, in the state of Valle del Cauca. My house is located in the neighborhood of Fundadores.

Now that you know my country, my state, my town, and my neighborhood, we can be more specific and enter my house.

<div style="display: flex;" style="background-color: blue">
    <div style="flex: 1; margin-left: 10px;"> 
    <p>
    This is my house. My house is in front of a park. It's next to other houses, and it's far from the commercial center of my town.
    </p>

    My bedroom has a space where I have my home office, where I work and do tasks related to the Sena, as well as assignments for the university. The dining room is next to the laundry room and kitchen.
